# mycat

Build binaries

    make

Remove binaries and clean extra files

    make clean

Run cat or mycat to use each file

    ./[cat-mycat] 
    ./[cat-mycat] file1.txt file2 in.txt

# To run the benchmark use Report1.1.ipynb

This Python program will create multiple files with diferent sizes of power of 5 of characters get the difference between running cat and mycat with the same file, and get an averge of the overall performance, then it will generate a graph showing the diferent times.

## Note: There is a report already generated under Report1.1/Report1.1.md
